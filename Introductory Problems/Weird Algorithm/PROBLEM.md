WIERD ALGORITHM
===============

# PROBLEM
<p align="center">Time limit: 1.00 s Memory limit: 512 MB</p>

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer **n**. If **n** is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if **n** is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until **n** is one. For example, the sequence for **n** = 3 is as follows:

<p align="center">3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</p>

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

# Input
The only input line contains an integer **n**.

# Output
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.

# Constraints
1 ≤ **n** ≤ 106

# Example
## Input:
``
3
```
## Output:
```
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
```
